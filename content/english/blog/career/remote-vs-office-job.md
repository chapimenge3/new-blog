As a software engineer, have you ever wondered what if you had taken a different path? What if you had chosen to work remotely instead of in an office?

Hey Everyone, I know it has been a while since I put up something on my blog. I was on a vacation and then I got busy with work. I am back now.

My remote job started in 2020 when i started applying to remote jobs in a platform called **Upwork**. People around me didn't think that the platform is for us(Ethiopian). So at that time i was very active in our university computer science club called **CSEC-ICPC**(i will talk about this more in another blog). Internet is free so i thought why not i give it a try to this "REMOTE JOB" thingy.

After a straight applying to a jobs and building my skills to be ready for the remote job world a week passed without any response from any client. And after a lot of tries i got my first client so that makes me eligible to call my self a REMOTE DEVELOPER. 

At that time it wasn't about the money i focused it was my reputation and my profile. So i worked for a very low price and i got a 5 star review from my client. After that i started getting more clients and i started to increase my price. And now i am working with a very good clients and i am getting paid a very good amount of money.

Now does am working as a Full time Software Developer for over year with a company in Bahrain onsite. I have got the taster of being a remote developer for more than 3 years before this. So let's break down the pros and cons of being a remote developer and an onsite developer.

## Remote Developer

### Pros

- I will be honest here, i am not a morning person or early bird. So i love to wake up late and start my day late. So being a remote developer gives me the freedom to wake up late and start my day late. I don't have to worry about being late to work.

- As a remote developer, no one is gonna bother you, monitor what's on your screen, or who is passing by your desk. You can do your work in your own way and in your own time. If there is no work you can do whatever you want to name a few **NEFLIX, YOUTUBE, GAMES, SLEEP, EAT, etc**. THIS IS THE BEST PART OF BEING A REMOTE DEVELOPER.

- You can work from your favorite coffee house or your favorite place to be at anytime just do your job on time and submit your work for further review.

- You will meet one of the SMARTEST people in the world. You will be working with people from all over the world. You will learn a lot from them and you will be able to share your knowledge with them.

- LET'S BE REAL HERE WHO DOESN'T LIKE TO WORK IN THEIR PAJAMAS. I know i do. IS THAT ENOUGH TO CONVINCE YOU TO BE A REMOTE DEVELOPER ? i am not trying to convince you to be a remote developer. I am just sharing my experience with you.

### Cons

- You will be working alone most of the time. You will be missing the office environment and the people around you. You will be missing the office gossip and the office politics.

- I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY THIS BUT I MISSED to just go to the office in the morning and trying to grab something that you need to take to your office like your office id or your laptop or your charger. I missed the morning rush to the office.

- You will be missing the jokes and the fun you have with your colleagues. You will be missing the office lunch and the office parties.

- CAN YOU BE BELIEVE somethings are just easier to be discussed in person than over a video call or a chat. I have felt that many times when i was working remotely.

- Remote work can be isolating. Not only to the office life but also to your family and friends. You will be missing the time you spend with your family and friends. You will be stuck in your chair staring at your computer screen for hours and hours.

## Onsite Developer

Now let's switch gears and talk about the onsite developer.

### Pros

- Working on person brings you closer to your colleagues. You will be able to build a strong relationship with your colleagues. You will be able to share your knowledge and learn from them.

- Sometimes small talks with your colleges can lead to a great idea. You will be able to share your ideas and get feedback from your colleagues.

- Let's say you get stuck in one bug where you forget to add a semicolon or a comma. Your colleague might see your frustration and help you out. You will be able to get help from your colleagues. You don't even have to ask for help. They will see your frustration and they will help you out.(ofc if they are nice people)

- Have you ever wonder where the heck are the idea over lunch comes from? You have no idea how many times i have got a great idea over lunch. You will be able to get a great idea over lunch or over a coffee break.

- I shouldn't be the first person to say this but if you think about it remote work is not as productive as onsite work. You will be able to get more work done in the office than at home.

these are just a few pros of being an onsite developer. I am sure there are a lot more pros of being an onsite developer.

### Cons

- GOD DAMN we really need to restrict to our wants and needs because WHO LOVES TO WAKE UP EARLY? I know i don't.

- How about sometimes you finish all your task early and you have to be stuck in the office for the rest of the day.

- All the pros of being a remote developer might be against you. You will be missing the freedom of being a remote developer.

- Thinking about the traffic and the time you spend on the road to get to your office makes me sick.

- You will be monitored and you can't even watch a youtube video even if that is gonna help you with your work. THIS DEPENDS ON YOUR BOSS. Honestly i got the best ones but i feel like some people will feel this as i felt it before.

As this are just one software engineer's experience. I am sure there are a lot more pros and cons of being a remote developer and an onsite developer. I am not trying to convince you to be a remote developer or an onsite developer. I am just sharing my experience with you. I hope this will help you to make a decision.

## Conclusion

Even tho both have a lot of pros and cons. I prefer to have a hybrid work environment where I go to office when i feel like it or work from my garage creating the NEXT FACEBOOK OR GOOGLE. Who knows you might see me on the cover of **FORBES MAGAZINE**.
