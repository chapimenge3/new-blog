Would I do things differently If I were meant to push the reset button on my career? Let's find out.

Hey Everyone, Lately I have been getting asked one question in a different format by a lot of beginners. The question might bot be the exact same but the meaning is the same. The question is "What would you do differently if you were to start your career again?". So I thought why not I write a blog about it and share my thoughts with you.

My Programming journey begins when I joined University yet my motivation comes from my father and now my dearest friend but my father lecturer.

So this post is dedicated to My Father Mengistu Ali and My Friend [Solomon Agizew](https://www.linkedin.com/in/solomon-agizew-33476b72/).

My Story begin when i was grade 6 and my father told me that i will change school to a private school and in over the year i will be learning and he will pay for my school fee and over the summer he will start his bachelor degree at Mizan Tepi University. At that time i was really kid and i didn't thought of how sweet this is and how much price he paid to pay my school fee.

Moving forward with a lot of ups and down when i got to 12th grade my father graduated from computer science and by the time he graduated i was so interested in computer science his teacher was my dearest friend. So i was so excited to learn from him and i was so excited to learn computer science.

The motivation for me to learn computer science was my father and my friend. So i started learning computer science. Here is the part that my answer for the above question starts.

**Disclaimer**: This is my personal opinion and it might not be the same for you. So take it with a grain of salt.

## What would i do when I start learning programming?

Aside from my university courses, I would start from the basics of C++. You know why? Understanding how C++ works at a low level will help me grasp the concepts of other programming languages. Once i got the understanding and syntax of C++, I would directly go to the data structure and algorithms concepts.

How do i learn data structure and algorithms? Most people took it for granted being a part of programming community, joining a community and learning together is the best energy booster you will ever get so i would join a community and learn together.

After joining the community by having a good competitive mindset i would start a programming challenges on different platforms but the main catch i would have is i might not go for [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/). The reason behind this is leetcode is generally perceived as a job interview preparation platform(by all means i am not saying it is not a good platform) but by that stage i wouldn't want to think about getting a job.

So if you ask what kind of platform i would go for? The easiest for me is [Open Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) when i started and move to [CodeForce](https://codeforces.com/) as i would be get more challenges and more competitive environment.

Let me mention a resource i would go for to learn C++ and DSA.

- [C++ Primer by Stanley Lippman Book](https://www.amazon.com/Primer-5th-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113)
- [Programming in C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup](https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Language-4th/dp/0321563840) Creator of C++
- [INTRODUCTION TO ALGORITHMS](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108986.Introduction_to_Algorithms)
- [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- [Visualgo](https://visualgo.net/en)

and many more resources that i would find on the internet.

Now once i do this for at least couple of month I would start doing some projects. Note that I am not saying you should stop doing competitive programming. I also want to mention i know you would have a school or other things to do so you might be able to adjust the time you spend on this.

For university student if you are thinking you don't have much time to do this i would say you are wrong. You have a lot of time to do this. You just have to manage your time and you will be able to do this. When you graduated the world is going to change as you really won't have time to do this by then, so better start now.

## What kind of projects would i do?

I would start with a simple project with the knowledge that i have which is a console application may be a banking system or a simple calculator. Now that i am comfortable at programming i would go for the next step which is Web Development.

Again this is how i would do it so your goal might be different than mine may be you might want to go for mobile app development or game development or any other thing. So you can adjust this to your goal.

I would start learning HTML, CSS and JS from [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) my favorite site because it is so simple and easy to understand. So what i am gonna do is once i learn these thing if i need a full course i might watch couple of youtube videos [Awesome Web Dev](https://github.com/markodenic/web-development-resources#youtube-channels) mentions a lot of resources that you can use to learn web development.

So honestly i would build a project which might look silly but i would build a project that i can use to learn and practice. For example

- blog site
- todo app
- weather app
- Tic Tac Toe
- etc

These project might look silly but it will help you a lot to learn and practice. Then now it is time to learn either frontend or backend. I would go for backend because i am more interested in backend.

So i would choose a backend language to get started with. I would choose either NodeJS or Python. My choice is kinda obvious because i am more interested in Python. So i would go for Python. but yours might be different.

So the most common mistakes i see from beginners is they start learning a framework without learning the language. So personally i would take some times how the programming language operates like Threading, Asynchronous, Multiprocessing, Interpretation or Compilation process, etc. This things are kind of low hanging fruits if you miss them it will gonna take you time to really even know you are missing them or when you code it is like driving a car in the dark you know you are driving but you don't know where you are going.

After the i get a grasp of the language i would start learning a framework, personally i would go for Django as i think it is the best framework for beginners. I would learn Django from the official documentation.

In my opinion **Django Web framework have the best documentation** than most of the framework out there.

Now the fundamental part of web development is having a knowledge of each part at a core level. Let's take an example

To know how Authentication and Authorization works instead of using a pre-made library implement it yourself. You will learn a lot from it. Like implementing Session Based Authentication is a really not that hard. I know people are afraid of implementing OAuth by themselves but I would say it is because they didn't understand how it works on the first place.

So Take a project that let's you implement these things by yourself. I would say a blog site is a good example. You can implement Authentication, Authorization, CRUD, etc.

Let's mention couple of project ideas that you can do.

- Blog Site
  - with Authentication and Authorization
  - Commenting System
  - Like System
- Bank Wallet
  - Authentication and Authorization
  - Deposit
  - Withdraw
  - Transfer
  - Analysis
  - Monthly Report
- E-Coomerce
  - Authentication and Authorization
  - Cart
  - Checkout
  - Payment with Stripe or any other payment gateway(crypto is a plus)
  - Order
  - etc
- Social Media
  - Authentication and Authorization
  - Post
  - Comment
  - Like
  - Share
  - etc
- Food Discovery
  - Authentication and Authorization
  - Search
  - Filter
  - Map integration
  - etc
- Stock Market
  - Authentication and Authorization
  - Time Series Data
  - Reporting with Graphs
  - Live Data updates
  - place a trade (if you are interested in trading) using a redis priority queue
  - much more

After finishing every single project if it is possible for me i would deploy them if possible and document the project very well. I would also write a blog about it. I would also share it on my social media and ask for feedback from my friends and colleagues.

## What would i do after this?

Here is the fun part everyone loves to read, Job Searching. Before i jump on searching a job i would organize every single project that are presentable and i finished and put them on portfolio.

Once i get all these done i will search for either online internship or on site internship to get my hands dirty and get some real world experience. This will increase my chance of getting a job and also confidence on how to work in a team.

Now Searching for paid job is a little bit hard now a days because of the job market is full of people who are looking for a job. I think we are still struggling from Covid Finance Crisis. So One thing we need to remember is we don't come here to give up. We come here to fight and win.

## Advice for beginners

I know this blog is kinda lengthy but i hope you get something out of it. I want to give you some advice that i think will help you a lot.

- Don't be afraid to ask for help. You are not alone. There are a lot of people who are willing to help you. So don't be afraid to ask for help.
- Don't compare yourself with others. You are unique in your own way. So don't compare yourself with others. If you think somebody is smarter than you, you are wrong you are just a little bit behind them. So don't compare yourself with others.
- Don't be afraid to fail. Failure is a part of life. You will fail a lot in your life. So don't be afraid to fail. Learn from your failure and move on.
- Listen to your seniors. They have been there and done that. So listen to them and learn from them. You may not agree with them but you will learn a lot from them.
- Compete with your friend and colleagues. Competition is a good thing. It will push you to do better. So compete with your friends and colleagues.
- Surround yourself with people who have the same mindset as you. You will learn a lot from them and you will be able to share your knowledge with them.
- Don't be with a people who are negative. They will bring you down. So don't be with a people who are negative.
- Don't fall into the tutorial hell. You will learn a lot from tutorials but you will learn more from building projects. So don't fall into the tutorial hell.
- Focus on one thing at a time. Don't try to learn everything at once. You will get overwhelmed and you will give up. So focus on one thing at a time.

The below is for getting a job.

- Apply super fast and reply as soon as possible. You will have a better chance of getting a job if you apply super fast and reply as soon as possible.
- Craft your cover letter and resume for the job specifically. Don't send the same cover letter and resume for every job. Craft your cover letter and resume for the job specifically.
- Stop trying the "spray and pray" method. You will not get a job by sending your resume to every job you see. So stop trying the "spray and pray" method.
- Have a professional looking Image, Linkedin, Github and also profile picture in every professional network.
- Take a motivation from the job description to your next project.
- Ask your friends and colleagues to refer you to the company they are working for.
- STAY POSITIVE. You will get a job. So STAY POSITIVE. BE PATIENT it will pay off.

## Conclusion

In conclusion my path would be like this. I would start from the basics of C++ and then move to DSA. Then i would start doing projects and learn web development. Then i would start learning a backend framework and build projects. Then i would start applying for jobs.

My biggest success for is my friends and the community we have [CSEC ASTU](https://www.linkedin.com/company/csec-astu/). I am so proud of them and i wanna mention some of my mentors and friends. Connect with them they are awesome. Click there names to connect with them.
