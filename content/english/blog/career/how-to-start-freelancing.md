## What is freelancing?

Freelancing is a form of self-employment where a person works independently for different clients. In other words, freelancers work for different clients at the same time. They are not tied to a single employer. They work for multiple clients at the same time. They are self-employed. If you are reading this, I am sure you know it to some extent.

## How to get your first client?

Before getting your first client there are things you must do, which are building up your portfolio. When i say portfolio i am not just saying your personal site, i am saying you have to have some project you have done to show case your client. Imagine that your client have never meet you, He don't know anything about you, how will he hire you ? It is by seeing your profile, your project and your cover letter(Proposal letter). 

I am gonna use Web development as it is my expertise but it will be applied to all of the skill set you have. 

The first thing you have to do is build a website that can be a good sample project which can show your skill very well. This might be some website which have 

- Nice UI (Fullstack or Frontend developers)
- Nice Database Design(preferably in picture) for Fullstack and Backend Developer
- Docker usage
- Well Structured Code
- Well Documented Code
- Tested (Automated)
- Includes CICD(use github Action preferably)
- Payment System integrated 
- Advanced framework usage
- Have Authentication(Multiple one by including Social Auth)

Include this all things in your projects. You can separate these functionality to different project but make sure to show them in your portfolio Section.

Make one or two project deployed and use free servers to do that checkout [my linkedin post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chapimenge_this-month-heroku-announce-they-are-going-activity-6972876512198815744--U7S?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) to see free server providers.

After you are sure to have something to present to your client, let's hunt for a client. You have to choose a platform to work as a freelancer so after that make sure to write a killer proposal or cover letter. Apply to all of them with customized proposal which address a client needs in your letter. 

The Magic for most of the freelancer is consistency to apply for a job and wait until you got your first client. I must say the first one is always the hardest of all. After you established your profile client will come to you.
