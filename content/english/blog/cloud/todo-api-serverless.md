If you are starting out with serverless and want to build a serverless application using python, then this blog post is for you.

As we discussed in my previous post about [Introduction to Serverless](https://blog.chapimenge.com/posts/serverless/introduction-serverless/), today we are going to build a very simple **Todo application** using Python, Serverless framework and AWS Lambda.

Today's content is focused on development and deployment of the application. So the topic we are going to cover is:

- [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites)
- [Create a Serverless project](#create-a-serverless-project)
- [Create dynamodb table](#create-dynamodb-table)
- [Create Lambda functions](#create-lambda-functions)
- [Deploy the application](#deploy-the-application)

without further ado, let's get started. Ready to get your hands dirty?

Open Your pc, Open your code editor and wear your superhero suit to start the journey of building a serverless application with me.

## Pre-requisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine and know basic of python.
- [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) and [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed on your machine.
- [Serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/) installed on your machine.
- [Git](https://https://git-scm.com/downloads) Installed and [Github] account for version controlling and remote repository. (**Optional**)

I know most of your didn't have [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account. Our current situation in **Ethiopia** it is not easy to get an AWS account. For that reason, I am going to connect my Master card to your aws account to use the AWS Free tier account. The catch is i have some question the first few people who answer correctly will get the aws account.

For the Contest please refer to this [here](/posts/serverless/todo-api-serverless/#contest)

### Pre-requisites in Activity

**Creating AWS IAM**

I am not going to teach you how to use your aws account in this blog but please follow the best practice and create IAM account even for your usage. Please see this [Blog by AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/setting-up.html)

So now we are going to create AWS IAM user for our deployment later usage. Here are the step your should follow:

1. Go to IAM by searching in aws search panel
   ![AWS-Search](/aws-search-panel.png)

2. Click **Users** in the left navigation bar and Click **Add Users**

3. Give a name of your choice in **User name** field and select **Access key - Programmatic access** under the **Select AWS access type**

4. After you click next, it let's you choose permission for the user. For now we are going to give Full Admin Access Yet in your real world application you have to make sure you give the right amount of permission for your user. Select **Create Group**

5. Give the name of your choice and select **AdministratorAccess** under **Policy name** and click **Create**

6. After you created the Group select the group for the our new user. After that click **Next** and skip the **tag** creation for now and Click **Review**. After all this Review everything you set like the name and other stuff anc click **Create User**

7. Make sure not to close the window before you grab the access key and Secret key. Put them in a safe place we are going to use them in a bit.

That is all for creating user. I promise you it is a very easy process to create this if you are scared because we have 7 step. I wanna make sure to led you at every step.

The next thing we are going to do is setting up our Serverless framework. It is also a very easy process.

1. Install NodeJs(LTS is better) for the serverless framework is build by NodeJs.
2. Install the serverless framework by using the below code

```bash
npm install -g serverless
```

3. configure AWS. Just paste your AWS Access key and secret key below

```bash
serverless config credentials --provider aws --key YOUR_ACCESS_KEY --secret YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

OR

```bash
sls config credentials --provider aws --key YOUR_ACCESS_KEY --secret YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

Serverless can be access in your command line by typing `serverless` or `sls`

4. There wont be 4th step üòú

## Create a Serverless project

If you are going to use Git and Github. Go create new repo and and clone it in your local machine. After that go to that directory and open terminal.

Now Open terminal and go to the directory you wanna work with. I suggest you have folder like project -> Serverless

Now let's initialize our project.

```bash
serverless
```

Enter and choose `AWS - Python - HTTP API`
Name for the project `Todo` or anything you want but make sure to change it for the rest of the blog.

Let's open our code editor and start looking at the project.

You will find a new folder in the current directory which is name same as the project name you given in the above process while creating project.

```
todo
‚îÇ   .gitignore
‚îÇ   handler.py
‚îÇ   README.md
|   serverless.yml
```

No go to your `serverless.yml` and paste the below code. I have put comment on it.

<!-- {{< gist chapimenge3 cd79e6e757895f7e6ee103e8a833a3e1 >}} -->

```yaml
service: Todo
frameworkVersion: "3"

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: python3.8

  # Totally optional, but it's a good idea to set this
  stage: dev
  profile: default # if you are working with different AWS account
  stackName: todo-stack
  logRetentionInDays: 14
  region: "us-east-1" # if you are working with different AWS region choose nearest to you

functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
    events:
      - httpApi:
          path: /
          method: get
```

You can skip the part that says Optional but I recommend to do it.

Now we are done with setting up the project. Let's move to DynamoDB stuff.

## Create dynamodb table

DynamoDB is aws fully managed NoSQL database. It is very simple and easy to use, Yet powerful to scale your database without worrying about sharding or any advanced stuff in database. If you want to read more please [here](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).

Now let's edit our DynamoDB in our `serverless.yml` file and paste the below code.

**Notice:** `#new` comment to indicate the added line of code.

<!-- {{< gist chapimenge3 f646d592c92d9eade916c34288307461 >}} -->

```yaml
service: Todo
frameworkVersion: "3"

# new
custom:
  tableName: "todo-table-${self:provider.stage}"

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: python3.8

  # Totally optional, but it's a good idea to set this
  stage: dev
  profile: default # if you are working with different AWS account
  stackName: todo-stack
  logRetentionInDays: 14
  region: "us-east-1" # if you are working with different AWS region choose nearest to you

  # new
  iam:
    role:
      statements:
        - Effect: Allow
          Action:
            - dynamodb:Query
            - dynamodb:Scan
            - dynamodb:GetItem
            - dynamodb:PutItem
            - dynamodb:UpdateItem
            - dynamodb:DeleteItem
          Resource:
            - Fn::GetAtt: [TodoTable, Arn]
  environment:
    TODO_TABLE: ${self:custom.tableName}

functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
    events:
      - httpApi:
          path: /
          method: get

# new
resources:
  Resources:
    TodoTable:
      Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
      Properties:
        AttributeDefinitions:
          - AttributeName: todoId
            AttributeType: S
        KeySchema:
          - AttributeName: todoId
            KeyType: HASH
        ProvisionedThroughput:
          ReadCapacityUnits: 1
          WriteCapacityUnits: 1
        TableName: ${self:custom.tableName}
```

Here what is happening is we are defining our Database Schema to be created when we deployed.

You might ask me so will it be create whenever we deployed ? The answer is No. Serverless will check the dynamo table using the name so if the name exists it won't create it. Instead it will grab it's `ARN` and use it to point to the DB. Another question pop up right?

What is ARN ? we wont keep up with these question because you might be educated about the cloud by the LEGENDARY ME üòù(like i know ntg). So ARN is Amazon Resource Names. Easy right. it is identifier of the resource. Like your name or your phone number identifies you.

We only define `todoId` in our dynamo if you notice it because we know have to give dynamodb the key or as we knew before same like primary key.

**Do you know in SQL primary key will be indexed by default which makes it very fast if you search by it's primary key**

Moving on we are done with the definition of our DynamoDB if you have any question pops it the comment section below.

## Create Lambda functions

So my plan is we are going to have 4 lambda functions:

    - Create Function
    - List Function
    - Update Function
    - Delete Function

Let's start with the Create Function. So our create function will do the below thing.

1. get the POST request body
2. extract the `todo` parameter from the body which is the only thing we need to create.
3. check if the name exists in our database if exist raise error
4. create the todo and return success or error message

Now open `handler.py` and paste the code below. I have describe the code using comment. If you don't understand it ask me in the comment section.

<!-- {{< gist chapimenge3 9fd38418d8d8a2146bd3869e29eab846 >}} -->

```python
import os
import boto3
import json

TODO_TABLE = os.getenv('TODO_TABLE')

dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
table = dynamodb.Table(TODO_TABLE)

def create_todo(event, context):
    '''
    Create Todo Application in Dynamo DB

    Params:
        event: API Gateway Event
        context: Lambda Context

    Return:
        response: API Gateway Response

    response.body: JSON String
        message: String
        todoId: String
        error: Boolean|String
    '''
    try:
        body = event['body']

        # check if the body is empty
        if body is None:
            raise Exception('Body is empty')

        # check if the body is a string and convert it to a dict
        if isinstance(body, str):
            body = json.loads(body)

        todo = body['todo']

        # check if the todo is empty
        if todo is None:
            raise Exception('Todo is empty')

        # check if todo is already in the table
        if table.get_item(Key={'todo': todo}).get('Item') is not None:
            raise Exception('Todo already exists')

        # create todo
        item = table.put_item(Item={'todo': todo, 'done': False})

        # return todoId
        response = {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': json.dumps({
                'message': 'Todo created',
                'todoId': item['todo'],
                'error': False
            })
        }

        return response

    except Exception as e:
        # return error
        response = {
            'statusCode': 400,
            'body': json.dumps({
                'message': str(e),
                'error': True
            })
        }

        return response

```

Now we can continue to the next function which is `List Function`

So the Steps will be

1. Get the POST request (am not going to consider customized pagination other than dynamodb default one)
2. Get all the list of the todo
3. Return the list

Open up the `handler.py` and append the below code. The code is documented and it is clear.

<!-- {{< gist chapimenge3 b20d9fbb971f0e99eaa9072059bc1788 >}} -->

```python
'''
this goes to Below the create_todo function
'''

def list_todo(event, context):
    '''
    List Todo Application in Dynamo DB

    Params:
        event: API Gateway Event
        context: Lambda Context

    Return:
        response: API Gateway Response

    response.body: JSON String
        message: String
        todos: List | None
        error: Boolean|String
    '''
    try:
        # list all todo
        response = table.scan()
        todos = response['Items']

        # return todos
        response = {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': json.dumps({
                'todos': todos,
                'error': False
            })
        }

        return response

    except Exception as e:
        # return error
        response = {
            'statusCode': 400,
            'body': json.dumps({
                'message': str(e),
                'error': True
            })
        }

        return response
```

The next function will be the Update function. One thing in the update is to make things easy in the update method we only update the `done` field which indicated if the todo is completed or not. So we only allow to be completed the todo.

Open up the `handler.py` and append the code below too. The code is documented and it is clear

<!-- {{< gist chapimenge3 0f020a10ff5101935675705f6aaaf1df >}} -->

```python
'''
this method goes to below the list_todo function
'''

def update(event, context):
    '''
    Update Todo Application in Dynamo DB

    Params:
        event: API Gateway Event
        context: Lambda Context

    Return:
        response: API Gateway Response

    response.body: JSON String
        message: String
        error: Boolean|String
    '''
    try:
        body = event['body']

        # check if the body is empty
        if body is None:
            raise Exception('Body is empty')

        # check if the body is a string and convert it to a dict
        if isinstance(body, str):
            body = json.loads(body)

        todo = body['todo']

        # check if the todo is empty
        if todo is None:
            raise Exception('Todo is empty')

        # check if todo is already in the table
        if table.get_item(Key={'todo': todo}).get('Item') is None:
            raise Exception('Todo does not exist')

        # update todo
        table.update_item(
            Key={'todo': todo},
            UpdateExpression='SET done = :done',
            ExpressionAttributeValues={
                ':done': True
            }
        )

        # return todoId
        response = {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': json.dumps({
                'message': 'Todo updated',
                'error': False
            })
        }

        return response

    except Exception as e:
        # return error
        response = {
            'statusCode': 400,
            'body': json.dumps({
                'message': str(e),
                'error': True
            })
        }

        return response
```

Now our last function will be ü•Åü•Åü•Å the DELETE function. hang on buddy we are almost finished with the code.

Open up the `handler.py` and append the code below too. The code is documented and it is clear

<!-- {{< gist chapimenge3 f7b5ef2e402d82ec11dcd7fee283fc33 >}} -->

```python
'''
this method goes to below the update_todo function
'''

def delete_todo(event, context):
    '''

    Params:
        event: API Gateway Event
        context: Lambda Context

    Return:
        response: API Gateway Response

    response.body: JSON String
        message: String
        error: Boolean|String
    '''
    try:
        body = event['body']

        # check if the body is empty
        if body is None:
            raise Exception('Body is empty')

        # check if the body is a string and convert it to a dict
        if isinstance(body, str):
            body = json.loads(body)

        todo = body['todo']

        # check if the todo is empty
        if todo is None:
            raise Exception('Todo is empty')

        # check if todo is already in the table
        if table.get_item(Key={'todo': todo}).get('Item') is None:
            raise Exception('Todo does not exist')

        # delete todo
        table.delete_item(Key={'todo': todo})

        # return todoId
        response = {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': json.dumps({
                'message': 'Todo deleted',
                'error': False
            })
        }

        return response

    except Exception as e:
        # return error
        response = {
            'statusCode': 400,
            'body': json.dumps({
                'message': str(e),
                'error': True
            })
        }

        return response
```

It is done. Our python code is done.

What is the next step ? you guessed it right connecting our python code to lambda function in the `serverless.yml` file.

Now open up `serverless.yml` and add the newly added code which is connecting our function to serverless lambda definition.

<!-- {{< gist chapimenge3 828053ce3622f09590015e0eeab32631 >}} -->

```yaml
service: Todo
frameworkVersion: "3"

custom:
  tableName: "todo-table-${self:provider.stage}"

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: python3.8

  # Totally optional, but it's a good idea to set this
  stage: dev
  profile: default # if you are working with different AWS account
  stackName: todo-stack
  logRetentionInDays: 14
  region: "us-east-1" # if you are working with different AWS region choose nearest to you

  # defining role for our lambda to access dynamodb
  iam:
    role:
      statements:
        - Effect: Allow
          Action:
            - dynamodb:Query
            - dynamodb:Scan
            - dynamodb:GetItem
            - dynamodb:PutItem
            - dynamodb:UpdateItem
            - dynamodb:DeleteItem
          Resource:
            - Fn::GetAtt: [TodoTable, Arn]
  environment:
    TODO_TABLE: ${self:custom.tableName}

functions:
  # new
  createTodo:
    handler: handler.create_todo
    events:
      - httpApi:

          method: post
  listTodos:
    handler: handler.list_todo
    events:
      - httpApi:

          method: get

  updateTodo:
    handler: handler.update_todo
    events:
      - httpApi:
          path: /update
          method: put

  deleteTodo:
    handler: handler.delete_todo
    events:
      - httpApi:

          ReadCapacityUnits: 1
          WriteCapacityUnits: 1
        TableName: ${self:custom.tableName}
```

Now What remains ? I know we didn't implement the todo-detail endpoint. This blog is just to get your hands dirty on serverless. There are many thing that can be improved but remember this is for the beginners.

## Deploy the application

The exciting part of it is deployment. This is making our magical application available to the internet or to the whole world. So what command do we need to deploy ?

![GIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/IxLeSDtUaZRmSiyCTf/giphy.gif)

This answer might be the most longest command we have in this blog. YEAAH right ? üòú üòÇ

So make sure you are in a folder where `serverless.yml` file exists and execute the below command to fire off and deploy everything we have done.

```bash
serverless deploy
```

![Deployed](https://media.giphy.com/media/b85mPT4Usz7fq/giphy.gif)

We have launched successfully

![Deployment](/todo-deployment.png)

Now you can play with the api as long as you want but in the mean time we have to delete everything as this is for only educational purposes. When you feel like you are done playing with the API delete the stack using the below code.

```bash
sls remove
```
